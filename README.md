cesium-elevation-gradient
=========================

An elevation visualiser for [Cesium](https://cesiumjs.org/) acting as an imagery provider.  Elevation samples from a terrain provider are passed to a 2D WebGL renderer.  The renderer then applies a combination of the following algorithms:

* Colour ramp
* Hillshade
* Contour lines

This imagery provider is a contribution to the Cesium community by [Propeller Aerobotics](https://www.propelleraero.com/) and is licensed under the same license as Cesium (Apache 2.0).
