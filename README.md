cesium-elevation-gradient
=========================

An elevation visualiser for Cesium.  Elevation samples from a terrain provider are passed to a 2D WebGL renderer.  The renderer then applies a combination of...

* Colour ramp on elevation value
* Hillshade algorithm
* Contours lines

This terrain provider is a contribution to the Cesium community by [Propeller Aerobotics](https://www.propelleraero.com/) and is licensed under the same license as Cesium (Apache 2.0).
